# Testudo Bank 
*Owner: Jillian Sands*

Testudo Bank is a banking application built for CMSC 389G: What to do After Landing a SWE Job. I took this class in Spring 2023 and worked on several different projects. Please see [my branches](https://github.com/jillsands/testudo-bank/branches) for examples :)

For the final assignment in the class, we were given freedom to choose a project that interested us. I chose to redesign the "Account Info" page to improve the user experience. Please view the [Design Doc](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1upEssAI8dPgqWjdt1IuaHoW9njlnLacG) and [final PR](https://github.com/s1ddh4rthc/testudo-bank/pull/132)!
